Description: Power and sample size calculations for logistic and Poisson regression.
    For logistic regression, functions can solve for alpha, power, sample size (N), or minimum detectable odds ratio.
    For Poisson regression, functions can solve for alpha, power, sample size (N), or minimum detecatable incidence rate ratio.
